# WeatherTop

Weather reporting application with CRUD functionality.

Made for learning purposes.

## Running

Clone the repo and `cd` into the project directory.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

User data is stored as JSON in `models/db/`.
The data persists locally but is ignored by
Git during development, which keeps the repo
clean.

To test user creation/editing/deletion you
will need to generate new users.

## Features

Some notable features include:

- Signup, login and logout independent users
- User-specific sessions
- Users can add multiple stations
- Dashboard organise stations alphabetically
- Users can add multiple reports per station
- Multiple data input methods (text and dropdown)
- Unique date/time for each report added
- Summary data generated from reports
- Weather summary icon generated based on weather code
- Individual stations and reports can be deleted by user
- Users can edit their personal details
